# ☕ Visualization of Coffee Plantation by Province in Indonesia and Export Analysis with FOB Value


This Streamlit web app presents visual insights into Indonesia's coffee plantation landscape by province and explores the export performance of coffee using Free on Board (FOB) values. The app is designed for interactive data exploration and analysis.

## 📊 Features

- 📍 Visualization of coffee plantation area and production by province.
- 📈 Trend analysis of production and productivity over the years.
- 🌎 Export analysis based on FOB value of coffee exports.
- 🧩 Easy-to-use interactive interface powered by Streamlit.

## 🗂️ Dataset Used

- `Luas dan produksi.xlsx`  
  → Contains data on coffee plantation area and production in Indonesia by province.

- `Ekspor kopi dan FOB value.xlsx`  
  → Contains Indonesian coffee export data and FOB (Free on Board) value per year.

Make sure both Excel files are available in the same directory as the main Python file when running locally or deploying.

## Goals

Understanding Coffee Plantation Output by Province in Indonesia and Total Coffee Exported Abroad Along with Its FOB Value.

## Case Overview

Indonesia is one of the world’s largest coffee producers, with a significant contribution to the global coffee export market. However, there are challenges in understanding the distribution of plantation potential, land productivity, and coffee trade patterns in order to achieve optimal results. Analysis is essential to support decision-makers, coffee farmers, and entrepreneurs in optimizing policies, improving production efficiency, and enhancing the competitiveness of Indonesian coffee in the global market.

## Problem

1. Which province has the largest coffee plantation area and the highest production output?
2. Is there a balance between plantation area and production volume?
3. Which are the main destination countries with the highest FOB values and export volumes?
4. What is the ratio between coffee production that is exported and that which remains for domestic use?
